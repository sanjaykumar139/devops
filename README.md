## Introduction
This project provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a DevOps pipeline for a .NET application. It includes examples and best practices for using Shell scripting, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP), and various CI/CD tools.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of .NET, DevOps, and cloud computing.
- Installed CLI tools for Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and cloud services.
- An active account on AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## Setup

### Shell Scripting
1. **Create a Shell Script**: Write a script to automate tasks such as building the .NET application, running tests, and deploying to a server.
    ```sh
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Building .NET application..."
    dotnet build

    echo "Running tests..."
    dotnet test

    echo "Deploying application..."
    # Add deployment commands here
    ```

### Docker
1. **Install Docker**: Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/).
2. **Create a Dockerfile**: Define the Docker image for your .NET application.
    ```dockerfile
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS base
    WORKDIR /app
    EXPOSE 80

    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build
    WORKDIR /src
    COPY . .
    RUN dotnet build -c Release -o /app/build

    FROM build AS publish
    RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app/publish

    FROM base AS final
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
    ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "YourApp.dll"]
    ```

### Kubernetes
1. **Install Kubernetes**: Follow the instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/).
2. **Create Kubernetes Manifests**: Define the deployment and service for your application.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: your-app
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: your-app
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: your-app
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: your-app
            image: your-docker-image
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: your-app-service
    spec:
      selector:
        app: your-app
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 80
      type: LoadBalancer
    ```

### Helm
1. **Install Helm**: Follow the instructions [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
2. **Create a Helm Chart**: Package your Kubernetes manifests into a Helm chart.
    ```sh
    helm create your-app
    # Customize the chart in the generated directory
    ```

### Cloud Services
1. **AWS**: Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, or EKS for deployment.
2. **Azure**: Use Azure App Service, AKS, or Azure Functions.
3. **GCP**: Use Google App Engine, GKE, or Cloud Functions.

### CI/CD Tools
1. **Azure DevOps**: Set up pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
2. **GitHub Actions**: Automate workflows with GitHub Actions.
3. **Jenkins**: Use Jenkins for building and deploying your application.
4. **GitLab CI/CD**: Use GitLab CI/CD for managing your DevOps pipeline.

## Usage
- Follow the setup instructions for each tool and service.
- Use the provided scripts and manifests to deploy and manage your .NET application.
- Refer to the official documentation for more advanced usage and best practices.
